**Week 8: Capstone Project - Building Your Final MERN Application**

**Objective:**

- Apply your knowledge of the MERN stack to build a full-fledged application.
- Demonstrate your understanding of project planning, architecture, and deployment.
- Develop a comprehensive portfolio project to showcase your skills.

**Project Overview:**

Your task is to design, architect, and present a full-stack MERN application of your choice. This final project should reflect the culmination of all concepts learned throughout the course, including front-end and back-end integration, authentication, CRUD operations, and deployment.

**Guidelines:**

### 1. **Project Selection**
Choose a project idea that aligns with your interests and skills. Some examples include:

- **E-commerce Store** – Users can browse products, add items to the cart, and checkout.
- **Task Management App** – Users can create, edit, and organize their tasks.
- **Social Media Platform** – Users can post content, comment, and interact with others.
- **Portfolio Website** – Showcase your projects, experience, and skills.

**Pro Tip:** Choose a project that highlights your unique strengths and interests.

### 3. **Project Architecture**

**Suggested Folder Structure:**
```
mern-capstone/
│-- backend/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── server.js
│-- frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── App.js
│-- README.md
```

**Essential Features to Implement:**

- **Backend:**
